yes,yes,"The hype is real and I have mature, dry skin!","I am in my late 60s with normal to dry skin and let me tell you, I'm already in love with this L'Or√©al Infallible Freshwear powder foundation! A lot of the reviews I've read have come from younger folks with oiler skin who rave about how awesome it is for oily, textured skin. Well, I'm here to tell you that my skin is mature, on the drier side, with dark spots, texture and wrinkles, and this stuff is magic IF you take the time to BUFF IT IN!! Thats the big key here. I just received my package and couldn't wait to try it out, so without prepping my skin like I usually do before applying foundation (although I still had whatever leftover skincare on my face from last night, which basically after 12 hours was gone), took a full, dense, soft powder foundation brush (Elf ultimate blending brush for example) and started working that baby into my skin. OMG the formula was so creamy I just kept blending and blending, and my pores started to disappear, my dark spots began to be less noticeable, and my skin had a smooth, creamy, natural appearance like no other powder foundation I've ever tried (that includes my high end products). Imagine with prepped skin how this could be! The hype is very real with this, I had to check it out for myself because I have dry, older skin, and sometimes powder foundations can make my skin look drier and too matte. Not this stuff, but the key for me was to buff buff buff it into my pores, which produced the creamiest, loveliest, soft matte glow that totally smoothed out my pores, lines, and nicely covered my dark spots. Not only will I continue using this gem, but will recommend it to my other mature friends and family, it is THAT GOOD.",5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20
yes,yes,This is one powder foundation to have in your collection!,"This is one the best makeup products of the year....I've have tested this many different ways over the last 2 weeks and it has held up every time....I have used this on it's own as a powder foundation,  with and without primer and over foundation as added coverage as a light setting powder....this stuff is great....it holds up.  My makeup looks flawless all day with minimal shine/ oil break through.  I'm not seeing any makeup transfer to a mask either but I'm not wearing one long hours. Since it is winter I cant test the sweat proofness of this but i will say since it is a powder foundation so make sure you have moisturized skin,  dry skin will show through a powder foundation.  This is one you need in your collection,  I find I'm reaching for it daily and I'm glad I bought it!",5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20
yes,yes,Pleasantly surprised by this powder,"I have been wearing the True match (W3 or W4 in summer) and decided to try this because I love the liquid foundation so much. Seriously, check that foundation out if you have not yet had a chance. I wear Linen in this powder and Linen in the liquid and they are a perfect match. it looked a tad light when I first applied it but only took a minute or 2 for it to melt into my skin for a perfect match. I am a light olive and sometimes the True match N3 is too beige and the W3 is a touch too yellow and this is a little of both.",5,B08GR521VL,Color Name: linen 180
yes,yes,MAYBE my new holy grail,"I really love this so far. Its VERY comparable to the jcat aquasurance powder foundation.  Apparently its a dupe for the newer fenty skin powder foundation.  It blurs my poors and provides medium to full coverage. It seems to tranfer less than the jcat one, which so far is not at all. It also has a faint pleasant fresh sent that i really enjoy, and it feels very lightweight on the skin. This might be my new holy grail foundation!",5,B08GR69H8P,Color Name: porcelaine 10
yes,yes,Believe the hype!!!,"I swear, I'm straight shook! I never believe the hype on social media or even makeup in general, but this product lives up to it. It is light weight and outperforms my expensive concealers and foundation. I did not receive this product as part of a promotion and I am not being paid to make this review, nor do I work in the makeup industry. This is the real deal.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,Mature Skins Best Friend!,"This is the best powder foundation I've ever tried and, believe me, I've tried a ton.Ladies, if you have mature skin, you know powders don't usually work for us.This powder foundation is perfect!It doesn't settle into lines and it doesn't look dry or caked. It covers any brown or red spots or blotches instantly.  I even had a small red spot on my forehead from my curling iron.  Gone!I tried this the first day I received it and I've used it everyday since.  I absolutely love the coverage and it doesn't look or feel like I'm wearing makeup at all.  It makes my skin look like it did years and years ago.  Smooth and even.This is what I've been looking for in a foundation.  It looks so natural and let's me look like me, only better. LolAnd I was sooooooo happy 2 foundations were included. What a deal!I tried it over my tinted moisturizer and that is the perfect combination for my dry skin.If I need to run to the store, I can put a little on and I'm out the door, looking great in a few seconds flat.I even fell asleep wearing this powder because I was too tired one night and, to be honest, it still looked pretty darn good in the morning. No blotchy skin. Kind of amazing.This foundation is a must have, in my opinion. I will never be without it.If you've been searching for 'the one', try this.  My search is over.10+ stars on this one!I hope this helps you.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,yes,it is a great product,"This product is absolutely wonderful and is everything it claims to do. I am 74 years old with good skin and only a few fine lines but have a couple of dark spots on one side of my face. For the first time since usingthis product in the colour 220 Sand, I immediately saw a wonderful difference in coverage, love the matteeffect, and that it really does not transfer. I apply it with a soft brush by stippling it on. It looks so verynatural on my medium skin tone.",5,B08GR52XQ3,Color Name: golden beige 140
yes,yes,PLEASE READ,"I‚Äôm usually a full coverage liquid foundation type of girl but I saw this product on TikTok and thought I would give it a try to see 1.) if I liked powder foundation 2.) if it could save me some time on my makeup routine 3.) if it was actually full coverage like it says. So I want to start off by saying DO NOT use a brush to apply this foundation. Just use the sponge it comes with. It makes the world of difference in the appearance of the foundation on your skin. I tried a kabuki brush first and then a regular powder brush. Application was horrible. Upon using the sponge it looked great. Secondly, if you‚Äôre addicted to full coverage foundation like me, this one takes some getting used to. It is buildable to get the coverage you want but is still more sheer than a liquid full coverage foundation as to be expected. However, the finish is very nice. It‚Äôs light weight on the skin, doesn‚Äôt make pores look large or lines look harsh. I wore it all day with no setting spray and while it will transfer easily onto clothes and other things it still lasted all day. Plus it only looks better it seems the longer you have it on. My only warning would be not to buy this product if you have ANY dry skin. Being that it‚Äôs a powder it does NOT hide dry skin. I personally have very oily skin and it worked very very well for me. It was also very simple to find a skin tone match which was surprising. I will definitely be purchasing again. I plan to still use my full coverage liquid foundation for special occasions but for everyday wear I will be switching over to this stuff.",5,B08GR52XQ3,Color Name: golden beige 140
yes,yes,BUY IT!,"Buy it, buy it, buy it! I ordered Tuesday and got it yesterday and right on time too. I did my foundation as usual, and used a big fluffy brush to apply this product. I useally cannot use powders or full coverage because my skin is so textured and dry but this left my skin very smooth and flawless. This will now be a permanent staple in my make up bag.",5,B08GR69H8P,Color Name: porcelaine 10
-,yes,Full Coverage!,"It was Perfect!! Very well packed and in great condition! It looks great on my skin. I bought #245 (Radiant Honey) and it provides full coverage with a natural, matte finish!",5,B08GRK7DPY,Color Name: radiant honey 245
yes,yes,Perfect for mask wearing,"I haven't used this as a foundation powder but as a setting powder to add a little coverage. I love using it that way. I find that it doesn't set makeup as well as my maybelline fit me loose powder does but, it adds coverage. I haven't noticed that it makes my makeup look cakey. I especially love to use it as a touch up powder. When I know I'll be wearing a mask, I pile it up on my nose and I don't loose nearly as much coverage on my nose. Its great to reapply during the day as well.",5,B08GR69YJX,Color Name: pearl 5
-,yes,Great lightweight foundation for light coverage!,"This is truly a pressed dry powder as I was honestly expecting a creamy powder foundation. I ordered the 130 true beige and it matched perfectly to my skin tone, I normally wear MAC studio fix in N5 for color comparison.The powder is lightweight and light coverage. I would not recommend this to someone looking for full coverage or even medium coverage. This is more of a coverage I would expect young makeup wearers to wear or someone just trying to control excessive shine/oil.While this powder foundation isn‚Äôt for me it is great. It‚Äôs a beautiful light coverage and does control excessive shine. It also does actually somehow stay on like a liquid foundation. I would highly recommend for the beauties with freckles that want a foundation that won‚Äôt hide them, this is for you!",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,The L'Oreal Fresh Wear Powder is a very fine product.,"This was a bit of a surprise.  I had ordered the Infallible Powder compact in the shade of True Beige, but received Pearl, a much lighter color.  I had been concerned that True Beige might be a little darker than my skin but took a chance.  Pearl looks to be the 1st on the spectrum of Fresh Wear colors, light with a pink cast.  Happily, it works very well with my fair complexion.  I was afraid it would be more of a Kabuki look, but it looks fine with my L'Oreal liquid foundation that's just a little darker.  The compact has two sides: bottom, a mirror and sponge applicator, and the top contains the finishing/foundation powder that smooths on easily and covers beautifully, and looks great on the face.  I happen to have a compact of Pro-Matte (up to16 hr.), but can't recall the color and it's almost gone, so this Fresh Wear (up to 24 hr.) will be next, if not now!  Both Infallibles are the same weight of .31 oz.  L'Oreal makes some really fine and excellent products, been using them for many years.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,Great coverage with brush,"I used a wet brush to swatch this foundation in my inner wrist, the coverage with a brush is great. It comes out pretty thick, not at all sheer the only thing was this shade was a bit too dark for me but I feel like i can mix it into my regular foundation once summers hits and I get tanned. I like the coverage it gives and I like it comes in a compact like packaging. This is my first L'Oreal foundation and I am very impressed.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,yes,A game changer.,"Wish they had corresponded these colors to their fresh wear Foundation liquid, so it was kind of hit and miss ordering the color. I wear 420 in the liquid and purchased true beige, but I think I would be better suited with the ivory buff. I also ordered the deeper color for contouring. You can spot apply this just to cover blemishes and dark spots, or use it as a full face Foundation. So much easier to use than liquid. Works on your hands too to cover dark spots. Looks very natural. Be sure and use sunscreen and moisturizer before hand, because this does not contain sunscreen, and with a moisturizer, it might look a little dry on your face. Love it love it love it. Hey L'Oreal, make a blush with this formula.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,yes,Easy and wonderful coverage,Never used a powder foundation on it's own...but this one really does give you nice coverage and conceals what you want to cover.  I am 68 and it does not settle into fine lines..I just dust it on with a foundation brush...use it as a eye shadow primer as well.  Stays put all day...no touch ups needed.  Very nice especially for summer.  Would recommend.,5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,yes,Best Drugstore Powded,I have purchased this 3 times in the color Sienna and it is perfect! Totally worth all the hype on tiktok. This is a very emollient powder that sticks to the skin. I prep with sunscreen then use this. The fragrance dissipates quickly. I noticed the actual powder is bouncy to the touch. Have not used the pelican or sponge it comes with. I like to use a powder brush. It gives me full coverage and I look flawless all day. I also don‚Äôt need to blot. And I am very oily. Will certainly continue to repurchase. This is the best powder I have tried since Mac Studio Fix.,5,B08GR521W1,Color Name: sienna 355
yes,yes,For younger crowd,Doubled the price from what is in cvs.TikTok did that but still. Also not for over 35. Makes you look like a pancake,5,B08GR514T1,Color Name: sand 220
yes,yes,Will buy again,Powder applied nicely and lasted most of the day. I was surprised that true beige 130 was quite light in color.,5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,yes,WOW! FILLS IN MY FINE LINES!!!!,"I don't have a lot of wrinkles,  but this product somehow makes them go away. A very natural looking product!",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,yes,excellent product,it provides great coverage w/o looking dusty or pasty...idk how to explain. it just looks great!!,5,B08GR6923F,Color Name: hazelnut 330
yes,yes,"Does Not melt off ,does not feel sticky,I Do Not Have to ReApply all the Time!!!","Applies Silky, no smell ,not cakeybeen wearing make up since I was 12 i am 64In all my years  This is The Best , Last All Day I Do Not have keep reapplying Love üíò",5,B08GR52XQ3,Color Name: golden beige 140
-,yes,Full coverage with matte finish look,"This powder foundation has medium to full coverage based on how you apply it. It has variety of shades (I think about 16 shades) so you have more options to choose from. It's super easy to apply it, you just need a brush or beauty sponge (makeup pads work as well). It blends perfectly and doesn't make your skin look cakey. I think it can be a better option for people who have oily skin as it's not very hydrating and it might not blend smoothly on dry skin. It has matte finish look and it doesn't need to be set by any translucent powder unless you have extra oily skin. It stays all day without any problem.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,I‚Äôm sold!,"For the price point you can‚Äôt beat it! I‚Äôve always been a fan of p√ºr brand powder but decided to try something new and this works just as well, if not better. I was so pleasantly surprised at how well this covered my blemishes and evened out my skin tone without looking cakey. It feels lightweight and easy to remove at the end of the day. My skin has not broken out since beginning to use either. Extra benefit that it came with two! I used a brush instead of the included pad. The compact also has a mirror. I ordered True Beige and it matched perfectly. Would definitely recommend.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,Beautiful Smooth Coverage!!!,"I love the look of this powder!!  It goes on smooth and doesn't dry out my skin, it takes away the shin and gives me a smooth even skin tone!!  Also hides my dark circles on bad days!!  Very nice lightweight and good price!! Thank you!!",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,yes,Impressive and I hate powder,"I don‚Äôt enjoy powder as it usually intensifies my fine lines. This doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm genuinely shocked at how easy it is to apply and how good it makes my face look. It‚Äôs full coverage and hardly transfers. I tried it because it‚Äôs supposed to be sweat resistant, it isn‚Äôt really but if I blot the sweat away the powder remains intact and stays on for hours. I like it so much I even bought a winter shade for when I don‚Äôt want the faff of applying liquid product. Really worth trying, very affordable and actually impressive.",5,B08GR52XQ3,Color Name: golden beige 140
yes,yes,Pour un maquillage rapide,"Fond de teint couvrant, mais pas trop non plus. J‚Äôaime la rapidit√© pour l‚Äôappliquer. Il tient vraiment longtemps et ne change pas de couleur. Donne un aspect naturel tout en cachant ce qui faut estomper (rougeurs, petits boutons, etc.).",5,B08GR69H8P,Color Name: porcelaine 10
yes,yes,Magical.  True magic.,"I dont know what sorcery this foundation is made with but its AMAZING.  I have forhead wrinkles which always crinkle with liquid formulas, not this stuff!  The coverage is FABULOUS, the matte finish is AMAZING, I may never go back to liquid foundation.",5,B08GR69YJX,Color Name: pearl 5
yes,yes,Good product and delivery,"I recently bought this after it being unavailable for a while. I was able to purchase one, and the product came sooner than expected. The delivery was fast, and I am liking the powder so far.",5,B08GR52XQ3,Color Name: golden beige 140
yes,yes,L'Oreal Paris Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation in a Powder,"I have tried so many powder foundations from Wander to Stila to Tarte to Revlon.  This is the BEST powder that really stays on until you wash it off.I live in the deep south where it's muggy and I sweat a lot.  In the winter, I use Wander b/c the heat isn't there but right now, this Infallible is my go-to foundation.The color selection is a bit bland.  When I'm going to an important event, I still use Wander powder because it's a better match to my skin tone but I dust lightly with this and my makeup stays on.The eyeliner and eye shadows are great too. The lip products are a bit drying.",5,B08GR514T1,Color Name: sand 220
yes,yes,Wow game changer,Never thought I'll be using dry foundation. It looks so good on me. Color o got is more my summer shade. But I still wear it during winter. Definitely purchase again and recommend. I'm grease ball don't matter what foundation I wear.. Yes I get little moist wearing this but nothing bad .I love the smell and medium coverage.,5,B08GR6923F,Color Name: hazelnut 330
yes,yes,shows every crease and wrinkled not recommended for mature skin 30yr and above a MAJOR NO NO !,I WAS SO EXCITED TO TRY THIS ..I heard RAVE REVIEWS FOR MONTHS .. what a disappointment!  Coverage is too cakey! Shows every crease and line .. would recommend to any 20 yr old but if your over 30 forget it .. I would recommend RIMMEL .. I noticed RIMMEL 001 TRANSLUCENT is less cakey and good coverage ..,5,B08GR69YJX,Color Name: pearl 5
yes,yes,Love this powder,"It leaves a smooth finish and it‚Äôs a great price.I use an expensive pressed powder brand but now that I‚Äôm not working i decided to try this. Didn‚Äôt disappoint, it might actually be my to go powder now .",5,B08GR521W1,Color Name: sienna 355
yes,yes,Smooths,"I can see what the hype is about, it's like smearing a filter on your skin that just smooths away blemishes or discoloration. I wish the smell was lighter,  it has kind of a thick floral scent to the compact,  but it's not bad.",5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20
yes,yes,Love it find a good primer gives a more skin like finish!,"I always like L‚ÄôOreal products or and sister companies. I think this is the best for oily to combination skin. Few things to keep in mind it is not full coverage buildable though, get a good primer and concealer for spot concealing. However, it give enough coverage where you do not need a lot of concealer! This my go to foundation there is a learning curve with power foundation and a great setting spray.",5,B08GR69YJX,Color Name: pearl 5
yes,yes,Great coverage lightweight and lasts all day,Great product although very long wait to be shipped - waited a month! Usually use ivory in any foundation and could have went shade darker in this. Lightweight and buildable great coverage.,5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20

-,yes,Excellent foundation in an easy to apply powder...,"I stopped using powder a few years ago because my skin started getting really dry. After moisturizing, powder wouldn‚Äôt spread easily so I‚Äôd have patches of powder but not a clean, smooth look. I went back to using foundation. I also tried using powder on top of that & still ended up with patchy areas.This L‚ÄôOreal product is a full matte foundation in a powder & I hadn‚Äôt tried that in years. I only had experience using powder foundation when Avon put one out many years ago & I wasn‚Äôt happy with the results. But nothing gained, nothing lost so I ordered this & I‚Äôm very glad I did.When it first came in, I put this on my bare face, mainly as a test to see what the coverage was going to be like. It was easy to apply with the sponge that‚Äôs kept underneath the powder product in the compact. There‚Äôs also a mirror in the bottom compartment.Several hours later, I checked & the powder looked just like it did when I applied it. I had to remove it with makeup remover. The coverage had been quite good.The next day, I put my skin treatment on my face following up with moisturizer. I let it settle in for a few minutes while I got dressed. Then I used the powder. It went on smoothly with no uneven patches anywhere. It covered well. I am very fortunate to have pretty clear skin & other than a few lines & small wrinkles I don‚Äôt have a lot to cover. Infallible Fresh Wear Powder Foundation doesn‚Äôt settle into the lines on my face & the pores on my nose are almost non-existent.This powder foundation covered every little discoloration on my skin, evened out my skin tone on my eyelids & under my eyes. The coverage was pretty great. My skin didn‚Äôt look cakey, just smooth with even skin tone. And it lasted all day & well into the evening. I‚Äôd guesstimate that it was over 14 hours.It came off completely & easily with makeup remover. I‚Äôve had the same results every time I‚Äôve used this product. Let the moisturizer settle in before using the powder to get the best results. I didn‚Äôt have to touch up at all during the whole time I was wearing the powder.I got Ivory Buff & the match is perfect & the color blended very well. I swept it along the jaw line to see if there was a mark of demarcation. There wasn‚Äôt. I could spread it down my neck with no obvious point where the color stopped or started.I‚Äôm very pleased with this foundation powder. I‚Äôd been sold on my old foundation & it wore well but I didn‚Äôt get the coverage I do with this powder. I also can use it on my eyelids & under my eyes, replacing concealer & eyeshadow primer. It goes on easy without caking, clogging pores or uneven coverage. It‚Äôs a pretty amazing product & one I‚Äôll stick with.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,A miracle powder...,"I never thought that I could forego liquid foundation until I tried this L'Oreal Paris Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation in a Powder. It is a creamy formula that starts out like a regular powder but transforms into this amazing foundation that blurs any imperfections on my skin. It is transfer proof, sweat proof, and it really does last all day. It does not cling to my dry patches or look cakey either. I use a moisturizer first then this foundation powder, and my skin has not looked better. I was on the fence about this product, but now I am glad I took a leap of faith and tried it. L'Oreal products never let me down.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,Great coverage; not a fan of the compact design.,"I got the color 130 true beige. I usually use ivory foundations.  This is slightly lighter than what I usually use but blends in well.It has good coverage, surprisingly covers blemishes well.I'm not a fan of the compact. I really don't like the sponge and mirror being in a separate compartment as the powder. The sponge was also squished in the hinge so it's a little deformed.Blush and highlighter or contouring powder doesn't show up as bright or strongly on this as it does any of the liquid foundations that I have.But for a quick addition to my morning routine its perfect to quickly cover up spots and get out the door.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,Covers Well but Without Heaviness,"I am not someone who can just put on a little gloss, mascara and powder and call it good.  I do not feel comfortable going out unless I am fully ""done"".  I will say, I used this several times over the weekend as my powder over my liquid foundation.  It was nice and light and made my foundation look flawless (as flawless as you can be at 52).  No cakiness whatsoever.  I used it once without foundation and it really did hide the redness on my face.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,My new favorite powder,I love this powder. It feels light on your skin but it had full coverage. It lasts all day even on the hotter muggy days. I would say this is a great alternative to the higher priced brands and this gives similar results.,5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
-,yes,Great powder foundation!,This is great stuff!It‚Äôs the right amount of lasting coverage that I need for day to day use. It‚Äôs nice and smooth.I like it. The shade is good also.Mine did arrive broken all to pieces but it‚Äôs still usable.,5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130

yes,-,Pleasantly suprised,"I saw this product on a reviews page and thought I'd try it. Managed to pick the right color first time around. I was nicely suprised that on my day off I could use this after simply washing my face and moisturizing. Nice and easy application. It's definitely buildable. Covers nicely and is matting. I probably wouldn't use this to replace my foundation or powder in my normal actual routine make up, but for a quick face of make up, this is great. And it's great for a touch up since it has that foundation base.",5,B08GR69H8P,Color Name: porcelaine 10
yes,-,Fantastic Foundation,"While I don‚Äôt find the colors to be all that accurate in the provided photos -these go on a bit differently than the photos made them seem they would -I finally hit pay dirt on the third purchase. Now that I‚Äôve found my true color, I LOVE this foundation! Very good coverage, and especially for a powder, though the powder does seem to have a slight creaminess to it. This can be as sheer, or fuller coverage as you make it. I have oily skin, and the staying power is fantastic, and doesn‚Äôt break me out. Love this foundation!",5,B08GR58ZBR,Color Name: golden sun 260
yes,-,As good as liquid,"Okay, let me start by saying I never leave actual reviews. I have cystic acne scars which on my tone are red/purple. This covers it! It covers my redness and evens out skin tone. Not using liquid foundation has improved my skin so much and I‚Äôm pretty shocked at how long this lasts. I do have oily skin so I have to touch up half the day with setting powder but that‚Äôs my norm. This does have a pretty strong scent but does dissipate. I‚Äôm definitely going to stock up on this!",5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20
yes,-,"Great, light foundation with powder-like finish","This product delivers everything it promises. It's easy to apply and stays on all day. Moreover, it is light enough to wear in hot weather, and it can be layered for more coverage, without looking too cakey. The sponge applicator works, but it does need to be cleaned fairly often. Overall, a great product that I will continue to purchase. One caveat: The colors, if ordered online, tend to be a tad lighter than pictured. I will need to go darker for the summer months. I highly recommend this product.",5,B08GR52XQ3,Color Name: golden beige 140
yes,-,Believe the hype,I am a tough critic especially on powder foundation...  I think for the price especially this by far is the best one I've personally ever used. I use it whenever I am in a hurry and don't want people thinking I'm a zombie lol.... I also use it to add a little extra coverage when needed with my liquid foundation.  This stuff is great addition to your purse,5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20
yes,-,Good Coverage and Finish,I love this powder. I personally wear it over my liquid foundation to add coverage although I have heard it's good enough to use on its own. I like how it adds coverage with a satin finish without being cakey. Also you only need a small amount each time so the product lasts very long. This could probably last me a year if I wore it daily.,5,B08GR69H8P,Color Name: porcelaine 10
yes,-,L‚ÄôOr√©al fresh wear powdered foundation,"I bought L‚ÄôOr√©al fresh wear infallible powdered foundation for the first time. I have to rate it five stars.! I absolutely enjoyed wearing it on my face for hours of hard work and sweat. Is buildable, and it is not sheer but has a matte tone to it. I purchased two and if I was gifted one for free I would so very much appreciate it in the tone porcelain or fair. Thanks:)",5,B08GR69YJX,Color Name: pearl 5
yes,-,Good price for Good Quality,Loreal has a good product with this Foundation powder.  Don't use the pad that comes with it or your face will be caked!  You need to apply with a big brush for a good coverage.  It is a quite a stretch that Loreal calls it 24 HR Wear...  I would say at the most 4 hours if you have oily skin or are in a humid environment.,5,B08GR58ZBR,Color Name: golden sun 260
yes,-,Holy Grail,"This is my Holy Grail of setting powders. It lasts all day and always looks so fresh. I‚Äôve never had it look cakey or dry, and I have dry skin.I apply with a brush, and it really does give my makeup and airbrushed finish. I hope they never discontinue this!",5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20
yes,-,New Summer Holy Grail Foundation,This Foundation is fantastic! I was looking for a foundation for the hot weather. I am outside quite a bit in the heat and I‚Äôm oily so Foundations tends to melt off my face. this is perfect it stays matte and it‚Äôs really easy to touch up if needed. I got one for home and for work so I‚Äôm never without it. great color match too! I highly recommend!,5,B08GR521VL,Color Name: linen 180
yes,-,Try this Powder formula!,"Wow, affordable but  acts like high end! Love it. Melts into the skin like a second layer of flawlessness! This powder foundation is worth the hype! Get it you won't be sorry. Only 1 slight complaint.. Doesn't last more then 8 hours without a oil blot and touch up though.",5,B08GR521VL,Color Name: linen 180
yes,-,Nice.,"The shade Radiant Honey is a very close match to a MAC powder foundation I‚Äôve been using (NC35). I received mines cracked like the other pictures that came with the review on here. However, there are plenty YouTube tutorials that shows how to fix cracked/crumbling eyeshadows in a pot with rubbing alcohol which works for powder foundation in a compact as well- which is what I did.",5,B08GRK7DPY,Color Name: radiant honey 245
yes,-,Good product!,"I like the porcelain color on my fair skin. This product has a sheer yet build-able coverage and a very fine powder consistency that can be used as a stand alone light to medium coverage foundation, finishing powder or on eyelids before eye-shadow application. Wears well for hours.",5,B08GR69YJX,Color Name: pearl 5
yes,-,Favorite powder foundation and setting powder,"I had return this product becuase I chose the wrong color but after finding my correct shade, I fell in love with the powder foundation!  I love to put it over my liquid foundation as a truly full cover make up day. It helps keep my make put all day and night! It's comfortable and beautiful. I have dry skin so I'd recommend putting plenty of moisturizer before applying this dryer product but other than that, it's fantastic.",5,B08GR514T1,Color Name: sand 220
yes,-,Covers completely without the mess of a creme foundation.,"Working in health care I wear a mask for 10 hrs a day. I still wanted coverage ,but the creme foundations were clogging my pores. This sheer powder foundation is great. It goes on smooth,and the coverage is amazing. At the end of my shift it still looks great no fading or crease lines.",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,-,Great product but was damaged upon delivery,"I love this product, it is the correct color/tone for my skin tone, goes on smooth and light.  Even though, upon opening the package upon delivery, the compact powder was broken, I was still able to try this product.",5,B08GRK7DPY,Color Name: radiant honey 245
yes,-,Fantastic item to have in your makeup collection!,"Quality item and is everything we hoped for! My daughter wanted this, so I ordered one for each of us and we are very pleased. Goes on beautiful and blends without effort!  Neither of us want to spend lots of time doing makeup and this is perfect!Will definitely buy again!",5,B08GR69YJX,Color Name: pearl 5
yes,-,"Use as powder, not foundation","Use as a powder, not foundation and your makeup will last so long with this! I pair this with the liquid infallible foundation or the colourpop pretty fresh and use a big fluffy brush and set the whole face with just a little of this and my makeup lasts all day, even under a mask!",5,B08GR5ZKVR,Color Name: ivory buff 125
yes,-,Great product for your buck,"This is a great powder foundation, works better than the big and expensive brands, it is full coverage, easy to wear, doesn‚Äôt look heavy in your face, it blends very well with other make up products. Totally worth it.",5,B08GR514T1,Color Name: sand 220
yes,-,All the rage face powder!,"My daughter loves this poweder! She‚Äôs always trying powders that her friends use or are trending and she always come backs to this one! It blends easily, doesn‚Äôt cause breakouts and has a nice coverage and natural finish! It lasts all day and I love the price point!",5,B08GR69H8P,Color Name: porcelaine 10
yes,-,"My opinion, not for dry skin","Well..its very cakey...BUT i figured how to use it for myself. Just a make-up brush i put on. If i use the little make-up pad it comes with, feels cakey and at sometimes lime its drying my face. I love it on top of my liquid foundation, again when applied with a brush",5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,-,Great coverage with a lightweight feel,"I saw this powder foundation on a video and took a chance purchasing it on Amazon. To my surprise, it‚Äôs lightweight, but has amazing coverage. I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing this again.",5,B08GR51PZG,Color Name: ivory 20
yes,-,LOVE!,I thought it would just be a powder but was pleasantly surprised! I put it on and it completely covered my flaws. It is light wearing but I had to get another color to match my skin tone. I still really lived this product A LOT!,5,B08GR64MJ2,Color Name: true beige 130
yes,-,Who needs foundation in the summer?,LOVE this stuff ... couple of swipes over moisturizer and I fit for public viewing!  Great coverage and colors.
